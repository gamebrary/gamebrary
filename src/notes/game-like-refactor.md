Looking at the `likeOrUnlikeGame` method, I would recommend reversing the order of operations. The current implementation updates the local state first and then tries to save to Firebase, which could lead to inconsistencies if the Firebase save fails.

Here's the suggested modification:

```vue:src/App.vue
    async likeOrUnlikeGame(gameId) {
      try {
        const isLiked = this.games?.[gameId];
        const mutation = isLiked ? 'UNLIKE_GAME' : 'LIKE_GAME';

        // First save to Firebase
        await this.$store.dispatch('SAVE_GAMES');

        // Then update local state after successful save
        this.$store.commit(mutation, gameId);

      } catch (e) {
        // Consider adding error handling here
        console.error('Failed to update game like status:', e);
      }
    },
```

The reasons for this approach:

1. **Data Consistency**: If the Firebase save fails, your local state won't be out of sync with the server state
2. **Error Recovery**: It's easier to handle failures because you haven't modified local state yet
3. **Optimistic UI Updates**: If you want to show immediate feedback to users, you could:
   - Show a loading state while the save is in progress
   - Or implement optimistic updates by committing first but rolling back if the save fails

However, there seems to be a potential issue with the current implementation: the `SAVE_GAMES` action is being called before the mutation, which means you're saving the old state. You might want to restructure your Vuex action to handle both the mutation and the save:

```javascript
// In your Vuex store
actions: {
  async TOGGLE_GAME_LIKE({ commit }, gameId) {
    try {
      const isLiked = this.state.games?.[gameId];
      const mutation = isLiked ? 'UNLIKE_GAME' : 'LIKE_GAME';

      // Save to Firebase first
      await firebase.saveGameLikeStatus(gameId, !isLiked);

      // Update local state after successful save
      commit(mutation, gameId);
    } catch (error) {
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

Then your component method would become:

```vue:src/App.vue
    async likeOrUnlikeGame(gameId) {
      try {
        await this.$store.dispatch('TOGGLE_GAME_LIKE', gameId);
      } catch (e) {
        console.error('Failed to update game like status:', e);
        // Show error to user
      }
    },
```

This approach provides better error handling, data consistency, and separation of concerns.
