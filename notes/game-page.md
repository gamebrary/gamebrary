This game detail page looks clean and user-friendly! Here's some feedback to enhance it further:

### Strengths:
1. **Visual Appeal**:
   - The large game cover on the left creates a visually appealing focus point.
   - The "You may also like" section is well-structured and encourages further exploration.

2. **Clear Game Details**:
   - The use of genres, themes, game modes, and platform info is informative and organized.
   - The completion progress bar is a nice interactive element.

3. **External Links**:
   - Including links to official resources (Twitter, Twitch, etc.) provides added value.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Typography**:
   - Consider increasing the font size for the game description to improve readability.
   - Use subtle bolding or colors for key details like "Available for" or "Game Mode" for better emphasis.

2. **Completion Bar**:
   - Adding a label (e.g., "Progress") to the progress bar might make its purpose clearer at a glance.

3. **Buy Button**:
   - The "Buy from Amazon" button is great, but adding a small Amazon logo could improve recognition.

4. **"You May Also Like" Section**:
   - Adding hover effects or more detailed information (e.g., platform or genre) for the games in this section could make it more engaging.

5. **Navigation**:
   - Consider adding breadcrumbs or a back button for easier navigation, especially if users want to return to their library or another page.

6. **Color Contrast**:
   - The completion bar's orange background with white text might be hard to read for some users. A darker text color or higher contrast background might help.

7. **Responsiveness**:
   - Ensure the layout adapts well to smaller screens, especially the progress bar and the "You may also like" carousel.
