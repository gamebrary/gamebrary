### Announcement: Gamebrary Licensing Change

Dear Gamebrary Users and Contributors,

We hope this message finds you well. After much consideration, we have decided to make a significant change to how Gamebrary is distributed and maintained. Starting today, Gamebrary will no longer be an open-source project. This decision was not made lightly, and we want to be transparent about the reasons and what this means for the community.

#### Why the Change?
Gamebrary has grown significantly since its inception, and we are incredibly grateful to everyone who has contributed code, feedback, and support over the years. As the project evolves, we want to focus on delivering a streamlined, professionally managed experience that aligns with our long-term vision. Closing the source will allow us to:

- Better protect our intellectual property.
- Introduce new features and updates with greater control.
- Ensure consistent branding and distribution of the software.

#### What Happens Next?
- **Repository Visibility**: The Gamebrary GitHub repository has been made private, and the source code is no longer publicly accessible.
- **Licensing**: The project is no longer distributed under an open-source license. Any previously released versions remain under their original license terms, but future updates will not include source code.
- **Distribution**: Future versions of Gamebrary will be distributed as binaries or packaged applications. We will provide clear instructions for installation and updates.

#### For Current Users
If you are using a version of Gamebrary released under an open-source license, you are free to continue using it in accordance with the terms of that license. However, we will not be providing updates or support for these versions moving forward.

#### Thank You
We want to express our deepest gratitude to everyone who has supported Gamebrary as an open-source project. Your contributions and enthusiasm have been instrumental in shaping what Gamebrary is today. While this marks the end of Gamebrary as an open-source initiative, we are excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to sharing them with you.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

Sincerely,
Gamebrary Team
