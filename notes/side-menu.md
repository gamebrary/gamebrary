The side menu has a clean and modern design! Here’s detailed feedback and suggestions for improvement:

### Strengths:
1. **User Avatar and Branding**:
   - The user profile with the avatar and background image adds personality and branding to the menu. It's visually engaging and gives a personal touch.

2. **Clear Organization**:
   - The menu is neatly categorized with intuitive labels like "Boards," "Games," "Tags," etc., making navigation straightforward.

3. **Accessibility Options**:
   - The icons for toggling light/dark mode and other settings at the bottom are well-placed for convenience.

4. **Minimalistic Footer**:
   - The "© 2025 Gamebrary" footer is subtle and unobtrusive, maintaining the clean design.

5. **Consistency**:
   - The sidebar is consistent with the overall app theme, blending seamlessly with the game detail page.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Active State Highlight**:
   - Highlight the currently active menu item (e.g., "Games") with a distinct background color, underline, or bold text for better user orientation.

2. **Search Bar Focus**:
   - The search bar could benefit from a slightly larger input field or a subtle border to make it more prominent and inviting to use.

3. **Collapsibility**:
   - Consider making the sidebar collapsible to save screen space, especially for smaller devices or in fullscreen gameplay views.

4. **Icon Alignment**:
   - Add subtle icons next to each menu item (e.g., a board icon for "Boards," a game controller for "Games") for faster visual recognition.

5. **Section Indicators**:
   - If a section (e.g., "Boards" or "Games") has new updates or changes, adding a small badge or indicator (e.g., a number for new items) can draw the user’s attention.

6. **Spacing and Typography**:
   - The menu items could use a bit more padding for improved touch target size, especially for mobile/tablet users.
   - A slight increase in font size for the menu labels might improve readability.

7. **Customizable Background**:
   - If possible, allow users to customize the sidebar background with themes or colors, adding personalization options.

8. **Hover Effects**:
   - Implement hover effects (e.g., background color change or slight scaling) for menu items to enhance interactivity.

9. **Footer Icons**:
   - Tooltips for the bottom icons (e.g., "Settings," "Dark Mode") could help users who might not immediately recognize them.

10. **Avatar Options**:
    - Consider adding a dropdown menu on the avatar for quick access to profile settings or logout.
